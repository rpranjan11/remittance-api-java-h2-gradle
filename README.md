### Implementation/Development Details
All the Assignment constraints and guidelines have been fulfilled as per my best understanding to them.
* The project is properly structured into standard layers that SpringBoot project follows
* All the 5 APIs are implemented as per the document provided and followed the specific API constraints provided in the document
* H2 Database is used which can accessed on http://localhost:8080/h2-console after running the app
* Only JSON has been used as Request and Response
* Authentication Token is implemented for the verification of API requests
* Logger is implemented for tracking the logs of code execution
* Error and Exception management is used on high-level due to less information provided about it
* Used Utility classes to separate the Utility functionality from the service/business logics
* JUnit Test cases are implemented for all the APIs in the test package
* There can be still a scope of code clean, implement any missed logic, introducing inner layers, proper error and exception management, unique Authentication & Authorization process, etc. to make the project production-level. Due to time constraint, I have focused to fulfill the most necessary constraints and deliver the assignment.
